# Gomoku Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Gomoku is a strategy board game played on a Go board. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15×15 of the 19×19 grid intersections. Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.
